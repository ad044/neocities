            </div>
            <p>Hello everyone! Long time no see. It's been a while since I've made this site, close to 2 years. I was
                planning to just leave the site be the way it was, but considering the amount of attention it got after
                fauux and Blackwings followed me, I thought I should make an update. Also, today's my birthday, I've
                turned 19, so I thought it'd fit well to post something now.
                <br><br>
                <span class="update2020--question">>Why no updates?</span><br>
                First of all let's get this out of the way.<br><br>
                My interests have changed. I just didn't enjoy writing
                static webpages anymore. I still program,
                arguably
                more than ever, but writing pure HTML/CSS/JS burned me out.<br><br>
                I still do front-end webdev, but mostly using React.<br>
                <br>
                <span class="update2020--question">>What's changed?</span><br>
                Well, considering I somehow gathered up the motivation to update the site, just writing a 100 line long
                paragraph wouldn't have been enough. I updated the code for all of the site, because it was atrociously
                bad. I've seen lots of people use my site as a template for their personal own, and I just felt bad
                having people use the abomination that the code my 17 year old self cobbled together was.
                <br><br>
                <span class="update2020--question">>What do you do now?</span><br>
                Nowadays I mostly work on dumb personal side-projects some of which you can check out on <a
                    href="https://github.com/d9x33">my GitHub</a>. <br><br>Programming language-wise, I mostly interest
                myself in the Lisp family (primarily Scheme and Racket), TypeScript,
                Python for Machine Learning, Data gathering/analysis, etc.
                and currently have a growing interest in functional programming. Basically, any language that isn't
                strictly Object-Oriented like C# or Java I usually find awesome. <br><br>
                Other than that, I'm also "passionate" about ganoo linucs. <br>For anyone curious - my setup:<br>
                <span class="yellow">Distro</span>: Arch<br>
                <span class="yellow">WM</span>: Xmonad/i3<br>
                <span class="yellow">Terminal Emu</span>: urxvt<br>
                <span class="yellow">Shell</span>: zsh
                <br><br>
                <span class="update2020--question">>Where may I find you?</span><br>
                Considering some people have had trouble contacting me in the past due to my past Discord tag being
                outdated, I
                thought I might aswell put some contact info here aswell. <br><br>I mostly hang out in <a
                    href="https://initiate.space">INITIATE</a> (the only website I really work on nowadays).
                <br><br><span class="update2020--question">As for my social accounts: </span><br>

                If you want to talk to me about anything, by all means feel free to dm me right away. im lonly.
                <br><br>
                <span class="update2020--question">>The future of this webpage?</span><br>
                I plan to just leave it be. I'll for sure post more updates in the upcoming years, but nothing too major
                will change.
                <br><br>
                And no, I'm not going to update the title each year from <span class="yellow">"the ramblings of a 17
                    year old fanatic"</span> to
                <span class="yellow">"the ramblings of a ${my current age} fanatic."</span> Not going to happen. I was
                17 when I designed this page,
                so it'll stay that way :^)

            <p>I go by the nickname "ad044", "antidepressant044" or simply "ad". Most active over at
                Apollo but I do
                visit every Lain-themed site/imageboard/whatever regularly. </p>
            <h3>How old are you?</h3>
            <p>
                I am 17 years of age.

            <h3>Where are you from?</h3>
            <p>
                I originally come from a different depressant which is not "Life". I'm on a mission to warn you b0is
                about the dangers of Adspace.

            <h2>Lain community related thoughts and shit</h2>
            <p>I've had an interest toward Lain and the fanbase around her for a while now. For the past couple months
                it's developed into more of an obsession.
                <br><br>
                This obsession comes with the urge to create something so fucking good that it would unite every
                separated Lain fandom into one big community where people could collaborate and create Lain-related
                stuff. Currently the situation is quite shit. You want to be a part of re:wire? Join their telegram,
                discord server, whatever. You want to be on Arisuchan/Lainchan, etc? Go post there. You want to worship
                some 17 year old schizophrenics fantasy that uses Lain as a mascot? Go to SS. You want to go against
                that 17 year old schizo? Go to Apollo. Most of these communities have personal relationships with each
                other, drama, friendship, you name it. It's difficult to acquire/give/manipulate information and ideas
                between some of these communities since they're so separated. Therefore collaborating for potentially
                good Lain projects becomes tougher than it should. I want to create a service that unites every Lain fan
                into one.
                <br><br>
                I look at Lain religiously. She gives me motivation to do anything, be it study, code, breathe, what the
                fuck ever. I want to do her justice. </p>

            <h2>Thoughts on Systemspace</h2>
            <p>
                Now the dudes that might look at this site would probably think that I go to bed thinking how I'd murder
                Tsuki with my bare hands. Not really. I meme the project just for the fuck of it. I don't have much
                against Tsuki or his crew except that I simply don't like them much because they've been cancerous to
                some members of re:wire in the past. Doxing is bad, b0i.
                <br><br>

                Don't get me wrong, I love the design of SS. It's my main inspiration for even creating this site. I
                think it's an absolute masterpiece made by good designers that were also terrible community managers/ill
                in the head. The entire site could have been used to create a high quality Lain cult along with other
                Lain communities and it definitely would have been a successful project. Instead they wasted the site's
                potential and only used Lain as a mascot for a weird play on simulation theory.
                That's just my view though. Some people would prefer that it never existed.
                <br><br>

                I also find the fact that Tsuki's only a couple days older than me pretty cute. </p>
